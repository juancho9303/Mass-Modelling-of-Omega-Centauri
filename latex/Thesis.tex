The mass modelling and formation history of galaxies have always been very interesting topics of Astrophysics and Cosmology. When you follow this routes it is perhaps inevitable the need of studying stellar systems inside galaxies (such as Globular Clusters) because they are present all along the way of the history, formation and structure of galaxies themselves. This thesis is intended to show our work on mass models of the local Globular Cluster $\omega$ Centauri with our data obtained in OPD observatory in Brazil and a recompilation of a good part of all available data of the cluster. By using stellar spectra of cluster members we compute radial velocities of the stars to obtain information about the velocity dispersion profile thus obtaining information about the potential well responsible for the dynamics of those individual stars. With this information, aside the mass estimations given by the photometry results, and in the context of the Jeans equations we can build mass models of the cluster looking for insight on the amount of dark matter present in this kind of structures, if dark matter is present at all.

I would like to thank my advisor and friend Juan Carlos Mu\~noz Cuartas for his constant efforts to guide me through this journey, not only in the academic part but also by giving me life lessons and tips to become a better professional and astronomer, his support, guidance and good will to help me with all my questions were a fundamental part of this work. His efforts came long before we started this project because he has always done everything he can to bring excellency to our academic program. I would also like to thank my professor and friend Jorge Zuluaga Callejas, whose work gave me the inspiration to study this beautiful career and because he has been part of my academic achievements from the very first moment I started my undergraduate studies, he has always shown great support for me and his efforts have set the high bar to professionals in Colombia that are truly committed to their jobs and bring knowledge to society.

Of course, I would like to thank my parents Hernando Espejo and Doris Salcedo, because everything that I have ever done including this thesis is because they have given me all their love and support and because they are my inspiration to make them feel proud. To my brother Leonel Ricardo Espejo, because he has been a fundamental role model in many aspects of my life. To many of my colleagues, friends and classmates such as Jorge Andr\'{e}s Villa, Nicol\'{a}s Gomez, Jaime Alvarado, Cesar Arroyo, Luis Fernando Quiroga, Daniel Arbelaez, Alejandro Guerra, Diego Bar\'{o}n, Fabio Cardona, Valentina Montoya, Denis Alvarez, Laura Arboleda, Yordan Arias, Carlos Boada and many more (if I typed all the names there would be too many) who gave me advise and helped me with theoretical and computational questions that were always present throughout this work and also because the fun and memorable moments that I had with them were an important part of the months I was working on this thesis.

To my basketball teammates in and out the court because they were another important aspect of my life as they kept me healthy and stable to be always willing to study and manage my time the best possible way. To all the cited authors who kindly helped science with their knowledge and efforts and because they were always willing to help me with any question regarding their data or their articles. To the LNA (Laborat\'orio Nacional de Astrof\'isica) for their financial support and their kind lodging that allowed us to acquire some of the data used in this thesis with the project I-034 in the OPD observatory.

To the University of Antioquia, the city of Medell\'{i}n, the professors and staff that were part of my formation as an astronomer and gave me the proper education to get me ready for my first serious research project, a project that I really enjoyed working on\ldots
