\section{Globular Clusters}

Typical galaxies all around the Universe hold different structures such as stellar systems of between $ 10^{2} $ and $ 10^{6} $ stars which orbit their galactic core. We call these interesting systems star clusters and they are basically divided into two main types: Open Clusters and \textbf{Globular Clusters}.

Globular clusters are very massive stellar systems that can contain from thousands to millions of stars in a nearly spherical distribution. These stellar systems are composed of old stars and they do not contain gas or dust.
